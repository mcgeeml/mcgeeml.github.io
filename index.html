    <p>Hello! My name is Myon McGee and welcome to my personal site. I am a Junior at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology majoring in Computer Science 
        and Minoring in Japanese.
    </p>
    <p>In this site you can view some of the project I completed and interact with them. If you select the portfolio option on this page, 
        you will be able to see these projects. Another piece of information about me that is avaliable is my resume, which can be found in
        the resume option on this page.
    </p>
    <p>Outside of school, I love playing Basketball, watching anime, and studying differenet languages. So far, Japanese has been my favorite 
        language to study.
